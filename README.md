# Server
The server is written using the *aiohttp* library and despite the fact that the LiveClassifier of [**joelbarmettlerUZH**](https://github.com/joelbarmettlerUZH/FaceClassification_Tensorflow) is not asynchronous, I tried badly anyway, but to combine their file with my project.

# Bot
The bot was created based on the aiogram library (*also an asynchronous library*) and does the same thing as the server, but it is not connected to the server itself, and does not send anything to it, but tries to recognize the face itself

# Site
In turn, the site was created for me by a [*good friend*](https://github.com/LolKekChebureck), his separate repository with the source code of the site pages [*code*](https://github.com/LolKekChebureck/face-bot)
<blockquote> Give him an asterisk </blockquote>

### The essence of the project
this project was created to show projects at the [Tchaikovsky Industrial College](http://spo-chic.ru/) on the relevant subject: individual project.

<blockquote> Hello to everyone who reads this github from College. Put an asterisk :) </blockquote>
